## About

My inventory management app was created using Node.js, Next.js, Javascript for backend logic, React and MaterialUI for frontend design and features, and Firebase for database and authentication.

I had not worked with these technologies before this project, It was hard but interesting learning more about them. I struggled and enjoyed the development process, got stuck but succeeded. This was an amazing and fun project. I have learned a LOT!

## AI API
In this project, I have used Gemini 1.5 Flash. Gemini was sent an API request to give a recipe suggestion to the user based on the items they had in their inventory. I prompted it so that some missing items would not hold it back. It will provide suggestions even if the user's inventory does not contain all the items. It will choose a recipe that prioritizes the stuff in the user's inventory before other recipes.

## Deploy on Vercel
