My inventory management app was created using Node.js, Next.js, Javascript for backend logic, React and MaterialUI for frontend design and features, and Firebase for database and authentication.

I have never worked with any of these technologies during this project, so I found it hard but very interesting. I struggled and enjoyed the development process, got stuck but succeeded. This was an amazing and fun project. I have learned a LOT!
